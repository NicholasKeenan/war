This program is the card game war
Two players (you and the computer) face off...
Each player draws a card and whoever has the highest card wins the round
This continues until one player is down to 1 card left and the other player wins the game

The thing not explicitely taught in class was handling 2 different structs, 1 being connected to the other
in this code that would be how there was a structure for players and cards, and each player had their own cards

How to Run the program:
  run the program with the added text file containing the card data
  ./game cards.txt
